# Anti Panic Attack NFT Collection!

This is the repo for the Anti Panic Attack NFT Collection by 72dpi. 

72dpi looked to find intersections of color combinations that can become hypnotic to the viewers and invite them
to zoom in and out while focusing, as a way of stimulating awareness and presence and in that way lower anxiety.

The files are prepared to be printed at 4500x800 pixels/ 62,5 x 111 inches/ 1.60 x 2 meters and they should be accompanied by a 432 h vibration when used for meditation. 


## Dependencies 

This project was created using...

- Node.JS 
- Hardhat 
- OpenZeppelin 
- Ethers
- React
- Chakra.UI.
- Infura

## Installation 

- Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/MarkoJauregui/antipanicattack.git` or by downloading the zip.

- Once you're in your projects source folder, run `npm install`. That will make sure you have all the required dependencies installed.

## Usage

1. Run `npx hardhat clean` in your terminal. That will make sure it will delete the artifacts folder *in the odd case you might have it by default* 

2. Run `npx hardhat compile` In order to compile the smart contract in the `contracts/` folder.  Which will create the artifacts folder.

3. You can now run `npx hardhat test` to make sure the smart contract has no vulnerabilities. If you decide to add more tests go enter the `test/test.js` file.

4. Create an account on https://infura.io/
